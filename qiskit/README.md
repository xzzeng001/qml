This is the alpha version of quantum meachine learning ansatz(QML-Ansatz) 
for ground-state energy calculation.
The idea is mainly inspired by the paper: Beer, K., Bondarenko, D., Farrelly, T. et al. Training deep quantum neural networks. Nat Commun 11, 808 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14454-2

It mainly contain the two simulation part:

****Classical:  calssical simualtion based on the matrix 

****Quantum : the quantum circuit simulation backend by the IBMQ
